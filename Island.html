    <h1>The British Island</h1>
    <p>The British Islands is a term within the law of the United Kingdom which since 1949 has referred collectively to the following four polities: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; the Bailiwick of Guernsey; and the Bailiwick of Jersey; the Isle of Man.</p>

    <h1>Weather</h1>
    <p>The climate of the British Isles is mild,[60] moist and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. It is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the Köppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe.[61][62] The North Atlantic Drift ("Gulf Stream"), which flows from the Gulf of Mexico, brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the islands' latitudes.</p>
